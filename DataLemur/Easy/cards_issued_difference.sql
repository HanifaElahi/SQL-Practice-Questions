-- Question: 

-- Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.
-- Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance. 
-- Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

SELECT 
  card_name, MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) AS difference
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name
ORDER BY difference DESC;
